BF3 ZOMBIES!
============

This is a PRoCon plugin for Battlefield 3 that implements a variant of the 
infantry only Team DeathMatch game mode. The US team members are the last surving humans 
in an area stricken by a mutated virus that turns people into zombies.
The RU team members are zombies.

Zombies are only allowed to use a knife as a weapon, but they are hard to kill.

Humans may use any weapon except explosives and rockets.

Each round starts with one zombie and everyone else a human.
