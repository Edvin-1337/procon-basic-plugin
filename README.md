ProCon 1.x BF3 Basic Plugin
===========================

__UNDER CONSTRUCTION! THIS PLUGIN IS NOT READY FOR USE YET!__

This is a [PRoCon 1.x plugin for Battlefield 3](https://github.com/Myrcon/Procon-1) that 
doesn't do anything. It is just the skeleton of a plugin. You can use it as
the starting point of a new plugin. It has many of the override functions
and convenience utilities that you need in most plugins.

Fork a copy of it and start adding your own functionality. Change the
name of the file, the class and anything else that needs changing.

__To Do__

* In-Game command registration/unregistration
